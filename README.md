## Overview
In these notes two data sets are analyzed using multivariate visualizations. The data set `pokemon.csv` contains various statistics such as height, weight, hp, and type for 807 different pokemon, and the data set `fuel-econ.csv` contains engine fuel economy data such as vehicle model, transmission type, displacement, and miles per gallon for 3,929 vehicles. The `Multivariate_Visualizations.ipynb` file uses `matplotlib` and `seaborn` visualizations to analyze the data sets using color, shape, size, and feature engineering with scatter plots, facet grids, point plots, clustered bar charts, box plots, heat maps, and plot matrices. The `Encodings_Practice.ipynb`, `Adapted_Plot_Practice.ipynb`, and `Additional_Plot_Practice.ipynb` files are additional practice for specific sections of this lesson.

## Requirements
This code depends on the following libraries:

1. `numpy`
2. `pandas`
3. `matplotlib.pyplot`
4. `seaborn`

In addition to these, the Jupyter Notebooks assume that the data sets, `fuel-econ.csv` and `pokemon.csv` have been extracted and are in the project folder.

The Binder badge above can be used to explore an executable environment for the `Multivariate_Visualizations.ipynb` file.
